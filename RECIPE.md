#Gluten-Free Lemon Meringue Pie#

###Crust:##
under construction

###Filling:###
* 1 average-sized lemon, rinsed and dried
* 1.5 c (100 g) sugar
* 1 stick (115 g) butter, in chunks
* 4 LG egg yolks/* 
* 1/4 tsp salt

###Meringue:###
* 4 LG egg whites
* 6 TBSP sugar

1. Pre-heat oven to 350F/180C
1. **Prepare the crust:** under construction.
2. **Prepare the filling:** Slice the lemon into thin wheels, remove seeds, and toss the rounds into a food processor with sugar and butter. Process, scraping sides as needed, until lemon is pureed.
2. Add remaining ingredients and pulse until batter is smooth.
4. Pour the lemon curd though a strainer directly into the pre-baked tart shell. **Do not** pour excess filling past the top of the crust or it may overflow during baking!
6. **Prepare the meringue:** In a large *very clean* glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form.
7. Spread meringue over the pie, ensuring filling is completely covered and edges are sealed.
8. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until meringue is golden brown.
